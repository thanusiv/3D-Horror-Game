## Overview

Link's True Journey Part 2 is a 3D first-person horror game created using Java and the libDGX library for my Grade 12 Computer Science Summative. 

The objective is to collect keys scattered around the map and place them in a generator. While on your search for keys, a monstrous ghost spider is trying to hunt you down. It can go through walls (no collisions :p) and will kill you if you get caught. You can stop the spider temporarily by placing stun grenades while you walk. You can get a few jumpscares if you aren't paying attention! 

**Note**: The title of this game has nothing to do with its content. It is a joke that a few of my friends came up with as sequel to my [Grade 11 project: Link's True Journey](https://github.com/thanusiv/Link-s-True-Journey)!
